    <h2> My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3># Baby Driver(9.3/10)</h3>
    <p>The plot of this movie is very sick which keeps you engaged and thrilled with twists, How can I boy with traumatic past can love while handling himself</p>

    <h3># Spirited Away(9.9/10)</h3>
    <p>Whenever we talk about movies of any kind we just can't look over "Studio Ghibli", Fantastic story with great animation</p>

    <h3># Spiderman - Into the spider verse(9.6/10)</h3>
    <p>Again one of the animated movies but the art style and the character development is top notch</p>
